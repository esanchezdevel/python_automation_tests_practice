Cucumber in python is used with Selenium

In Python to use cucumber the library that has to be installed is "behave"

- `python -m pip install behave`

To configure cucumber, we need to have the following directories

__some_path:
            |
            |__features (contains all features files with .feature extension)
            |
            |__steps (contains all steps files programmed with python)
